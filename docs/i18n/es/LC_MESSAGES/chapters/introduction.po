"`pgRouting <http://www.pgrouting.org>`_ adds routing functionality to "
"`PostGIS <http://www.postgis.org>`_. This introductory workshop will show "
"you how. It gives a practical example of how to use the new pgRouting "
"release with `OpenStreetMap <http://www.openstreetmap.org>`_ road network "
"data. It explains the steps to prepare the data, make routing queries, "
"assign costs, write a custom function 'plpgsql' function and use the new "
"`OpenLayers 3 <http://ol3js.org>`_ to show your route in a web-mapping "
"application."

"Navigation for road networks requires complex routing algorithms that "
"support turn restrictions and even time-dependent attributes. pgRouting is "
"an extendable open-source library that provides a variety of tools for "
"shortest path search as extension of PostgreSQL and PostGIS. The workshop "
"will explain about shortest path search with pgRouting in real road networks"
" and how the data structure is important to get faster results. Also you "
"will learn about difficulties and limitations of pgRouting in GIS "
"applications."

"To give a practical example the workshop makes use of OpenStreetMap data of "
"Nottingham. You will learn how to convert the data into the required format "
"and how to calibrate the data with “cost” attributes. Furthermore we will "
"tell you what else pgRouting provides beside “Dijkstra”, “A-Star” and "
"“Shooting-Star” and what has been added recently to the library. By the end "
"of the workshop you will have a good understanding of how to use pgRouting "
"and how to get your network data prepared."

"To learn how to get the output from rows and columns to be drawn on a map, "
"we will build a basic map GUI with OpenLayers 3. We listened to the students"
" feedback of the last year’s and want to guide you through the basic steps "
"to build a simple browser application. Our goal is to make this as easy as "
"possible, and to show that it’s not difficult to integrate with other FOSS4G"
" tools. Writing a custom PostgreSQL stored procedure in 'plpgsql' will allow"
" us to make shortest path queries through Geoserver in a convenient way."
